-You need to run the programs with python3

train.py uses a linear regression on data.csv, you don't need to give any arguments to run the program, it will simply perform a linear regression on the informations given by data.csv and write the result inside thetas.csv

predict_car_price.py needs 1 parameters (the second one is optionnal)
-first is the mileage (ex: 50000)
-the second one is -g or --graph, it will show you the result of the linear regression on a graph
thanks to matplotlib.pyplot
